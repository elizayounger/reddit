Joke responses at the parent-level will be removed. Accounts using AI to generate answers will be banned. Follow-up questions at the top level are allowed. (Link only responses are permitted if they are asking for a subreddit.)\n\nDo not answer by only dropping a link and do not tell users they should "google it." Include a summary of the link or answer the question yourself.\n\n#Rule 2: Please try searching here before posting a new question\n\nTry to keep repeat posts to a minimum. As much as we love answering questions here, it doesn\'t help when we see repeat questions on the front page every day. You can find the questions that have come up here again and again in our [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq).\n\n#Rule 3: Be Nice\n\nFollow Reddiquette:  Be polite and respectful in your exchanges. NSQ is supposed to be a helpful resource for confused redditors. Civil disagreements can happen, but insults should not. Personal attacks, slurs, bigotry, etc. are not permitted at any time.\n\n#Rule 4: No medical advice questions\n\nNo medical advice questions\n\nA rule of thumb would be: Could this question or its answers make someone decide not to go see a doctor when they really should?\n\nIf you are asking here to avoid bothering a doctor, you probably should bother a doctor.\n\n#Rule 5: No trolling or joke questions\n\nDisallowed: questions that are joke or trolling questions, memes, just song lyrics as title, etc. \n\n#Rule 6: No suicide or \'was I raped/sexual assaulted/sexually harrassed?\' questions\n\nSuicide related questions are best handled by the resources they have at r/SuicideWatch.\n\n#Rule 7: No self-promotion, shilling or begging\n\nNo trying to draw traffic to product/video/podcast/website by phrasing it in the form of a question. \n\nAsking for upvotes, birthday wishes, handouts, or fundraising support fall under this as well. Please see more appropriate subreddits for that. \n\nNo questions trying to elicit participation without learning anything of substance from the answers.\n\n#Rule 8: No illegal/unethical or disturbing subject matter\n\nNothing like "Where can I find a copy of (movie/show/music) for free online?" There are other places for asking that, this is not one of them.\n\nTasteless or disturbing questions regarding loli, pedophilia, murder, violence or other sketchy or disgusting subject matter are not welcome here. You are welcome to ask good faith questions about such topics but be aware such threads may be locked or removed if necessary to preserve the integrity of the subreddit.\n\n#Rule 9: No disguised rants, agenda posts, potstirring, disruptive topics\n\nQuestions not asked in good faith - such as a rant or hate towards any group in the form of a question, as well as leading questions, or those asked merely to promote an agenda will be removed.\n\nWe are a small, volunteer mod team and there is a limit to our ability to respond to brigading and trolling from Reddit at large. We reserve the right to make judgement calls on when a particular thread becomes disruptive to the sub, and we are unable to maintain a civil space for the discussion.',

Examples of low effort posts would be posting excessive screenshots and low effort memes\n\nSelf-Promo Rules: Please follow Reddit\'s guidelines for self-promo content\n\n"For every 1 time you post self-promotional content, 9 other posts (submissions or comments) should not contain self-promotional content."  \n\n7. **Tav Posting** Character screenshots must be posted in the Tav Tuesday Megathread.

Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you\'re right, or you\'re the asshole.\n\nThis is the sub to lay out your  actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you.  Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should reflect real situations, and abide by the rules below.\n\nAfter 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  ***The power of the crowd will judge you***.  If your top level comment has the highest number of upvotes in a thread, you will get a flair point. More details are listed in [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq).\n\n---\n\n#Important Links\n\n* ##[Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n* ##[How To Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/howtopost)\n\n* Visit our sister subreddit /r/AmItheButtface/ for posts about fiction or relationships, and basically anything that we don\'t allow here! /r/AmItheCloaca for posts from animals and /r/AmItheGrasshole for all your lawncare conflicts!\n\n* See our *~~Best Of~~* "Most Controversial" at /r/AITAFiltered \n\n* Looking for some Regional Assholes? /r/AkoBaYungGago/ /r/BenIkDeEikel /r/BinIchDasArschloch /r/EuSouOBabaca  /r/suisjeletroudeballe  \n\n* See our [resources for those in an unhealthy or abusive relationship](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/resources) and [resources for members of the LGBTQIA+ community that might need help or support](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/resources/lgbtqiaplus)\n\n* https://al-anon.org/ and http://www.teen-anon.com/\n\n* https://smartrecovery.org/\n\n* https://www.childhelp.org/\n\n---\n\n#Voting Guide\n\nIn your top level comment be sure to include one abbreviation for your judgment, i.e.\n\n**YTA** = You\'re the Asshole; \n\n**YWBTA** = You Would Be the Asshole;\n\n**NTA** = Not the A-hole (and the other person is); \n\n**YWNBTA** = You Would Not be the Asshole  (and the other person would);\n\n**ESH** = Everyone Sucks here;\n \n**NAH** = No A-holes here; \n\n**INFO** = Not Enough Info \n\n---\n\n#**Rules**\n\n##1. Be Civil\n\nAttack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives. Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.\n\nThis rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don\'t insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don\'t lecture people about the rules (use reports).\n\nBe respectful. Be nice. Don\'t be an asshole.\n\n##2. Voting Rules\n\nUpvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. **DON\'T** downvote if you think OP is an asshole. **DON\'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH.** Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don’t engage. \n\nDon\'t participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. **Violations will earn a permanent ban.**\n\n##3. Accept Your Judgment\n\nThis sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.\n\n##4. Never Delete An Active Discussion\n\nDO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for **at least 48 hours**. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.\n\n##5. No Violence\n\nDon\'t even *mention* violence.\n\nThe rule isn\'t about inciting or encouraging violence. It\'s about **not mentioning.**\nPosts or comments that reference or mention violence in any manner do not belong here. \n\nComments &amp; even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, "bad karma," property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone, even hypothetically, is strictly prohibited. **Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.**\n\n##6. How To Post\n\nThe TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.\n\nPosts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don\'t link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can\'t explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else\'s account or a shared account.\n\n##7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts\n\nPosts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be "the asshole."\n\nSubmissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.\n\n##8. No Shitposts\n\nPosts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.\n\nThis is not a humor sub. This isn\'t a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.\n\nShitposting will result in a permanent ban.\n\n##9. Do Not Ask For Advice\n\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.\n\nYou may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.\n\nIf a thread\'s focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP\'s intent.\n\n##10. Updates and META posts are restricted\n\nPosts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed &amp; may result in a ban.\n\nUpdate posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the [update criteria](https://tinyurl.com/zn2kbnnw) for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.\n \nThis is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.\n\n##11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts\n\nAITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:\n\n- AITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with \\**anyone** (or not). \n- AITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)\n- AITA for doing a sexual act (or not)\n- Reproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)\n- Posts about cheating- including "exposing" someone\'s cheating (or not).\n- Or [similar conflicts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq/#wiki_rule_11.3A_no_partings.2Frelationship.2Fsex.2Freproductive_autonomy_posts) that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.\n\n##12. This Is Not A Debate Sub\n\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you\'re ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.\n\nNo starting off topic debates about marginalized groups\n\n##13. No Revenge Stories\n\nThere are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you\'re here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you\'re probably breaking this rule.\n\n##14. No Medical Conflicts\n\nAITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit\'s paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.\n\n##15. Review the FAQ Before Participating\n\nSubreddit rules are intended to provide a brief overview of our sub\'s content standards.

HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit\'s policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5.

No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed.

This includes build help, tech support, and any kind of doubt one might have about PC ownership.\r\n* You don\'t necessarily need a PC to be a member of the PCMR. You just have to love PCs.

[Nor did it start as one](//pcmasterrace.org/history). This is a [normal subreddit with occasional tongue-in-cheek humor elements](//pcmasterrace.org/community). We are a community where many of its members share similar opinions about the main topics, and sometimes end up having private jokes amongst ourselves.  We are not a community where members feign stupidity when posting and commenting because they find it funny. You can be banned if you conduct yourself like that here.\r\n* Owning a console does not necessarily make you a [\'peasant\'](//pcmasterrace.org/consolepeasants).\r\n* We created Reddit\'s most popular [Wiki](/r/pcmasterrace/w/).\r\n* If needed, you can [message the team behind PCMR](//reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/pcmasterrace).\r\n\r\n---\r\n#[Rules](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules)\r\n\r\nFor an in-depth explanation of our rules don\'t forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules).\r\n\r\n* [**Rule #1**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.231) Harassment of others is strictly forbidden. We will not tolerate any kind of incitement to action against anyone, nor will we allow the posting of information that can be used to harm others (celebrities or not).\r\n* [**Rule #2**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.232) We will not allow behavior contrary to [PCMR Etiquette](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/etiquette), e.g. brigading, witch-hunting, asking for upvotes or downvotes, enabling piracy, flamebaiting, clickbaiting, intentional rudeness, text spamming, using all caps or emojis/smileys/emoticons in titles or overusing them in comments, meta-reddit or meta-subreddit drama or complaints.\r\n* [**Rule #3**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.233) Don\'t link to threads in other subreddits. This includes NP links and archived links. Do not attempt to circumvent this rule by any means.\r\n* [**Rule #4**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.234) Screenshots of Reddit, Facebook, Youtube, and other site\'s comments should have the usernames blacked out (including yours). Celebrities are the exception, as long as you respect rule #1.\r\n* [**Rule #5**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.235) No affiliate/referral links or codes.\r\n* [**Rule #6**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.236) The following will be removed at moderator discretion: \r\n - 6.1: Content that is either low quality, unrelated, especially unoriginal, or low-effort (including, but not limited to: simple website/software bugs, steam/product reviews, comedic product/system specs, steam gift messages, screenshots of conversations, internet speed test results, negligible price reductions, items that aren\'t PC related, even if they are named similarly or resemble it, online petitions and surveys that aren\'t academic in nature (and have been pre-approved by the mod team).\r\n - 6.2: Pictures of purchase or shipping related notifications and information.\r\n - 6.3: Blatant reposts/fad-chasing.\r\n - 6.4: Reaction content (images/gifs/memes), unless very high-quality/especially original.\r\n - 6.5: [Concern trolling](//goo.gl/TPnnnw).\r\n - 6.6: Feigning idiocy when posting or commenting, or linking to such content.\r\n* [**Rule #7**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.237) Age, nationality, race, gender, ability, sexuality, religion, political affiliation and economic status are all irrelevant here. All are welcome in the PC Master Race. Also, linking the PC Master Race with racial supremacy or any kind of fascist ideologies, or making distasteful analogies in this regard, is not acceptable in the slightest.\r\n* [**Rule #8**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.238) No begging. No [soft begging](https://goo.gl/4J9rq6). No Implicit or explicit trading. No buying. No Selling. No asking for valuation. No asking how or where to do these either.\r\n* [**Rule #9**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.239) Message the mods first, and wait for permission, if your post/comment is NSFW. Do not mark your post as NSFW or as Spoiler unless it actually is NSFW or a Spoiler.\r\n* [**Rule #10**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.2310) Screenshots of "peasantry," including but not limited to conversations on Reddit, other websites or sms/chat screenshots where ignorance is being spewed and/or ridiculed, must be text posts.\r\n\r\n#Giveaway Rules\r\n\r\nFor an in-depth explanation of our giveaway rules don\'t forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_giveaway_rules).\r\n\r\n* The Master Race is generous. When doing giveaways please keep it within the bounds of our subreddit and only for subreddit members. Feel free to give prizes as you see fit, but don\'t mandate subscriptions or other benefits. You can post about your channel or project, but don\'t make it a requirement to visit, comment or subscribe to an external place to enter a giveaway or to increase the likelihood of winning.\r\n* Under special circumstances, we allow giveaways to be external and/or to require users to visit a page outside the subreddit, but that must conform to our [outside giveaway guidelines](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/rules#wiki_outside_giveaway_guidelines).\r\n* Even if you do a giveaway, you can not directly promote a specific giveaway happening elsewhere without prior mod approval.\r\n* Please [avoid posting keys in plain text or on images](/3ys6wv). Consider PMs as a safer way to hand out keys.\r\n* Users giving away physical items must provide photo proof of ownership (including their username and date) in the giveaway thread. Shipping fees must be entirely financed by the user doing the giveaway (limiting the winner\'s location is allowed).\r\n* No conditional (I will only giveaway if) giveaways.
